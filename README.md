# Question 3

# 3.1) What aspect of the implementation did you find easy.If any,and why?

* Setting up the database was easy. I used postgresql,which made it easier to deploy on to heroku. 
* Writing query statements was simple

# 3.2) What aspect of the impelementation did you find hard,if any,and why?

* Deploying on heroku was tough. Heroku logs are difficult to interpret if the deployment goes wrong
* Making ajax call for every row in the database was difficult

# 3.3) If you were to use these technologies professionally, What would be your biggest concern?

* Ruby on rails takes significant amount of time to boot if it involves more gems and file
* Not all hosts can support ruby on rails
* Ruby on rails is not as fast as C and Java programming languages
* Postgres is considerably slower than MySql
* Replication is not much powerful in Postgresql as other databases
